<h2>INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER NETWORKS</h2>
 <p> A computer Network refers to a group of computers that can communicate with each other and share network resources.Networking refers to interconnection of two or more computers and their associated devices for the purpose of communication and sharing of network resources.</p>
<h3>REASONS FOR NETWORKING COMPUTERS</h3>
 <p>
  <ol>
     <li> Sharing of hardware resources E.g. Printers, Scanners, Disks for storage, Input output units.</li>
     <li> For Communication Purpose E.g. Sending of Emails</li>
     <li> For sharing software resources (Application programs, Data files, Software’s, Computing power etc.) through servers.</li>
     <li>For network gaming E.g A lot of network games are available, which allow users to play from different locations.</li>
  </ol>
<h4>BASIC HARDWARE COMPONENTS OF A NETWORK</h4>
 <p>The most common hardware components of a network include;
  <ol>
     <li>TERMINAL- This is an input or output device of a network which can be compromised of:
             <div>
              <ol>
             <li>Dumb Terminal</li>
             <li>Graphic Terminal</li>
             <li>Intelligent Terminal</li>
              </div>
     <li>WORKSTATION-  This is a stand-alone computer equipped with its own processor system and application software.It can perform its functions depending on the network or it may be connected to the network to expand its resources.</li>

     <li>CLIENTS- This is a computer that accesses shared resources from the networks.</li>

     <li>SERVER COMPUTER- This is a computer that shares its resources across the network.</li>
     NB: According to the size and the required networks, servers can be classified as;
                          <div>
                           <ol>
                          <li>File Server- This is a computer that shares programs, data files and software across the network.</li>
                          <li>Database Server- This is a server that shares database applications and database resourcesthe network.</li>
                          <li>Print Server- This is a server that shares printers and printing services across the network.</li>
                          <li>Disk Server- This is a server with large storage capacities and it is used to share the storage across the network.</li>
                          </div>
 <li>NETWROK INTERFACE CARD- This is a physical database between the computer and the transmission media.</li>
                         Performs the following tasks:
                         <div>
                           <ol>
                         <li>• Establishes the network connection.</li>
                         <li>• Translate digital data into from the source computer signals for outgoing messages and vice versa.</li>
                         <li>• Converts a serial incoming data into parallel data and vice versa.</li>
                         <li>• It has a buffer when data can be held temporarily to control the flow of data.</li>
                         </div>
 <li>TRANSMISSION MEDIA- This is the path between the source and the destination which can either be wired transmission media or wireless transmission media.</li>
 <li>HUB- This is a network device whose function is to centralize the linear segments.It is used as a centralizing device in a network i.e. It organizes the cables and relays network signals into other linear segments.</li>
                       There are three types of HUB’s;
                          <div>
                            <ol>
                          <li>Passive HUB- It only acts as a connection point.</li>
                          - It doesn’t amplify or regenerate network signals therefore’ it doesn’t require power to operate
                          <li>Active HUB- It amplifies or regenerates networks signals then transmits them to all the network devices connected.</li>
                          -It requires power to operate.
                          <li>Intelligent HUB-It functions as an active HUB but retransmits the signals only through the destination path, therefore, performs an intelligent path selection to the destination.</li>
                            </ol>
<li>NETWORK REPEATERS-  It is a network device that allows only to extend the physical length of the network.</li>
                      - They are installed from the network link to receive the signals before they become too weak or corrupted, and regenerates the original bit pattern then puts the refreshed signal back to the network link thereby increasing the physical size of the network.
                      - The location of the repeater is very important in a network and must be placed in a network so that it receives the signals before they are very weak or corrupted.
